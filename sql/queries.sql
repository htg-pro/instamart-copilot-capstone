-- Q1: WHERE then HAVING
-- Keep only completed orders with order_amount > 500 (WHERE),
-- group by customer, and keep customers whose total of those orders exceeds 8000 (HAVING).
-- Reference: 30 customers.

-- Q2: Three-Table Join
-- Revenue by city and product category (join orders, customers, products).
-- Reference: 30 rows, the 30 revenues add up to INR 2,998,668.80,
-- the largest cell is Bengaluru / Electronics at INR 233,909.45.

-- Products priced above the average catalogue price.
-- Reference: 11 products.
SELECT

-- One CTE computes each customer's total completed spend and a second computes the average of those totals;
-- the main query returns customers whose total is above the average.
-- Reference: 550 customers; average INR 2,552.06 (rounded to 2 decimals).
